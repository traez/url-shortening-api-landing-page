## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project has limited end user functionality, so building it wasn't so exciting. Despite that, the build process was comparatively tasking at my current level. But I'm happy to have seen it through as it came with a lot of learnings. 

1. Learned methodology of building projects where the HTML is differently structured between the mobile and desktop view. Made me see how important and powerful React is, as against regular Vanilla JavaScript.
2. Learned about the existence of "custom React hooks".
3. Learned about the existence of "third-party libraries" (usehooks-ts, react-responsive, Material UI etc).
4. Learned about instances where to use "useRef" ahead of "useEffect".
5. Learned about how differently the use of Local Storage is in Next.js.

### Continued development

More Next.js projects. GraphQL projects too in the longer term.
